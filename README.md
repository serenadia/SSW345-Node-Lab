# Node Lab

## RESULTS

I was able to complete this lab fully and I learned a lot about APIs. I don't have screen shots of the responses on my browser, but I do have a screen shot of me adding the developer to the server.

## PROGRESS

While this lab may seem as a small assignment, I learned a lot about commiting code to Github. In the past, I used to manually upload the files onto Github, which is usually very tedious and sometimes I don't upload all the correct files. This lab helped me learn and improve my Github skills while also improving my mySQL skills.

## PROBLEMS

I didn't experience too many problems while completing this lab, majority of them were small user issues, such as typos I made or not using VSCode correctly. The biggest problem I faced was commiting my code to Github. I tried using Github Desktop, terminal, which didn't work but, I used the commit feature on VSCode which worked for me.
